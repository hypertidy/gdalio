Description: Convenience wrapper for the GDAL raster warper library. Set a default context grid, an extent, 
 dimension, projection, and then read any GDAL raster source into that grid. There are controls to augment
 metadata-poor sources (to override missing or incorrect extent or projection metadata), to set a desired grid
 for subsequent use, and ability to control options available by the GDAL warp library itself. This can be 
 used to easily read data from any kind of raster data source, local files, online servers, bare URLs, and database
 connections. Data is read in generic form but we provide example wrappers for commonly used formats for raster
 data.
